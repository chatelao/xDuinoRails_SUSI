## 1 General

### 1.1 Purpose of the Standard

This standard describes the configuration variables for the interface defined in [RCN-600] between a main module, hereinafter referred to as the **Host**, and expansion modules, hereinafter referred to as **SUSI modules**, sometimes simply "modules," in a model. These can be sound modules, extended function outputs, or other function modules. The name SUSI is an abbreviation for "Serial User Standard Interface".

### 1.2 Requirements

To comply with this standard, all mentioned configuration variables, or CVs, may only be used in the specified manner.

## 2 Configuration Variables (CVs)

The CVs reserved for SUSI are in the range of 897 to 1024 (see [RCN-225]).

The maximum of three SUSI modules that can be connected to SUSI must each be assigned to a valid CV range for the respective module before installation. These ranges are CV 900 to 939 for SUSI module 1, CV 940 to 979 for SUSI module 2, and CV 980 to 1019 for SUSI module 3.

CVs 897 to 899 and 1020 to 1024 are valid for all modules, regardless of their module number. Reading these CVs is only meaningful with a single connected module and should be avoided in normal operation as soon as multiple modules are connected.

| CV Name | CV# Mod 1 | CV# Mod 2 | CV# Mod 3 | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SUSI Module # | 897 | | | Meaning fixed |
| SUSI CV-Banking | 898 | | | Volatile, obsolete variant |
| Manufacturer Specific | 899 | | | Already used |
| Manufacturer ID | 900.0 | 940.0 | 980.0 | Only in Bank 0; fixed |
| Hardware ID | 900.1 | 940.1 | 980.1 | Only in Bank 1; fixed |
| Manufacturer ID 2 | 900.254 | 940.254 | 980.254 | Only in Bank 254; reserved |
| Version Number | 901.0 | 941.0 | 981.0 | Only in Bank 0; fixed |
| Sub-version Number | 901.1 | 941.1 | 981.1 | Only in Bank 1; fixed |
| SUSI Version | 901.254 | 941.254 | 981.254 | Only in Bank 254; supported SUSI version |
| Manufacturer Specific | 902 - 939 | 942 - 979 | 982 - 1019 | |
| Status Bits | 1020 | | | Bit 0-3 = WAIT, SLOW, HOLD & STOP |
| SUSI CV-Banking | 1021 | | | Non-volatile, recommended |
| Reserved | 1022-1024 | | | |

**Table 1: List of CVs**

The CVs marked as "fixed" must—if implemented—fulfill the specified functions. The reserved CVs and bits must not be used and must contain a 0.

## 3 Banks with Configuration Data for RCN-218

For the automatic registration of a decoder at the central station according to [RCN-218], the decoder also needs the information of the functions implemented in the connected SUSI modules. This data is stored in special banks and is retrieved by the decoder via CV Bank Read according to [RCN-601] Section 3.

Bank 253 contains the function information, as it is stored in data space 2 of the decoder from byte 11. To easily link the data of the SUSI modules with that of the decoder, only the information for F0 is stored in bits 6 and 7 of the first byte (CV 900/940/980), and then in the second byte for the functions F1 to 8, etc. Two bits are reserved for each function:
- **00** = Function is not available.
- **01** = Function is available and can be used as a switch (e.g., light).
- **10** = Function is available and can be used as a momentary switch.

Banks 252 to 248 contain a static mapping of function numbers to function icons for the implemented functions, as stored in data space 4 of the decoder from byte 2. One byte is stored for the function number, followed by one or two bytes for the icon index. The actual space required depends on the number of supported functions and whether the icon indices require one or two bytes. In the 5 reserved banks, two-byte icon indices of up to 66 functions can be stored. The exact encoding rule is defined in [TN-218].
